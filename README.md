# AIC

AIC (Agent Interaction Contract) is an open contract and tooling stack for making web apps reliably operable by AI agents.

It is currently optimized for teams instrumenting **owned React/Next/Vite apps** with explicit AIC metadata.

## What Works Today

- runtime UI manifests with stable IDs, confirmation, entity, workflow, execution, recovery, and validation metadata
- generated discovery, action, permissions, and workflow manifests
- guarded CLI apply for exact-match source edits
- offline bootstrap from saved captures with reviewed outputs
- reference consumer proof showing external resolution by contract instead of selector-first fallbacks
- explicit `@aic/*/client` entrypoints for Next/RSC-aware consumption of React-facing packages
- coding-agent onboarding templates plus `aic init` and `aic doctor` for app repos adopting AIC
- alpha npm packaging prep for the core `@aic/*` publish wave, including tarball smoke tests and a release workflow

## Not Guaranteed Yet

- arbitrary third-party sites
- zero-touch onboarding of dynamic codebases
- heuristic repo mutation
- non-React production coverage
- live npm alpha publication from this repo has not happened yet

## Start Here

- [Next checkout example](./examples/nextjs-checkout-demo)
- [Vite CRM example](./examples/react-basic)
- [Bootstrap example](./examples/bootstrap-openai)
- [Coding Agent Onboarding](./docs/coding-agents.md)
- [npm Packages](./docs/npm-packages.md)
- [Supported Today](./docs/supported-today.md)
- [Reference consumer proof](./tests/reference-consumer.test.mjs)

## Repo Status

- Public GitHub launch ready
- First-wave packages are prepared for alpha npm publishing
- Actual npm publication still requires a release run with npm credentials

## npm Alpha Packaging

- The first npm wave targets the core publishable packages under the existing `@aic/*` scope.
- `@aic/devtools` and the example apps remain repo-only for now.
- Package release plumbing uses Changesets plus a manual GitHub Actions publish workflow.
- See [npm-packages.md](./docs/npm-packages.md) for the package matrix and install targets after publish.

## Coding Agent Onboarding

- The canonical coding-agent instructions for this repo live in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).
- Tool-specific wrappers live in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md), [GEMINI.md](./GEMINI.md), [.github/copilot-instructions.md](./.github/copilot-instructions.md), and [.cursor/rules/aic.mdc](./.cursor/rules/aic.mdc).
- Run `aic init [project-root]` to scaffold `aic.project.json` plus the recommended onboarding files into an app repo.
- Run `aic doctor [project-root]` to audit config presence, onboarding files, scan coverage, diagnostics, and generated-manifest validity without mutating source files.
- Copy-ready starter files still live under [templates/agent-onboarding](./templates/agent-onboarding) for manual or external-tool use.
- `aic generate project ... --out-dir ...` now records optional onboarding warnings in `report.json` when the recommended repo-level agent files are missing or stale.

## Key Idea

Expose what the page means, not what the DOM looks like.

## Bootstrap Flow

- Capture routes with Playwright or provide saved captures to the CLI.
- Generate a structured prompt payload from `@aic/ai-bootstrap`.
- Feed that payload to your model provider and save the returned suggestion JSON.
- Or point the CLI at an HTTP model endpoint with `--provider-endpoint` and `--provider-model`.
- Or use the OpenAI shortcut with `--provider-kind openai --provider-model <model>`.
- Run `aic bootstrap <url> --captures-file <file> --suggestions-file <file>` to build a reviewable bundle without requiring a live browser session.
- For model-backed providers, use `--provider-timeout-ms` and `--provider-retries` to keep transient failures predictable. The defaults are `30000` ms and `2` retries.
- Add `--prompt-file`, `--draft-file`, `--review-file`, and `--report-file` to write bootstrap artifacts to disk.
- Use `--min-confidence` and `--max-suggestions` to keep the accepted draft subset deterministic while still preserving filtered suggestions inside the review bundle.

See [examples/bootstrap-openai/README.md](./examples/bootstrap-openai/README.md) for a copyable OpenAI-based workflow from saved captures.

## Automation Flow

- Run `aic init [project-root]` to scaffold onboarding files and a starter `aic.project.json`.
- Annotate controls with explicit `agent*` props.
- Run `aic doctor [project-root]` before artifact generation to surface missing config, onboarding drift, empty workflows/policies, extraction diagnostics, and invalid generated manifests.
- Run `aic scan <path>` to see extracted matches, deterministic source inventory entries, and diagnostics.
- Run `aic generate project <config-file> [--out-dir <dir>]` to emit discovery, UI, action, permissions, workflow, and `operate.txt` artifacts together. When `--out-dir` is used, the CLI also writes a review `report.json` with extracted matches, source inventory, and diagnostics.
- Run `aic diff <discovery|ui|permissions|workflows|actions> <before> <after>` for stable summary output.
- Add `--format detailed` when you need field-level before/after values for changed manifest entries.

## Devtools Flow

- Mount `AICDevtoolsBridge` next to `AICProvider` in development to emit live registry snapshots from the page.
- Use the in-app `AICDevtoolsOverlay` for quick visual checks.
- Use the browser extension popup for active-tab status.
- Use the browser DevTools panel for filtering, baseline capture, diffing, DOM discovery, imported `report.json` / bootstrap review context, and authoring patch-plan export.
- Run `aic apply authoring-plan <plan-file> --project-root <dir>` for a dry-run apply result, then add `--write` to commit guarded JSX prop edits for exact source matches.
- If the bridge is absent, the extension falls back to `/.well-known/agent/ui`.

## Example Coverage

- `examples/nextjs-checkout-demo`
  Proves structured confirmation on a critical checkout action, async save plus recovery metadata, validation guidance on coupon entry, and entity-bound order-line actions.
- `examples/react-basic`
  Proves CRM-style confirmation, async execution plus recovery, entity identity, workflow-linked controls, and validation-bearing note capture using the shadcn wrapper surface.

## Verification

- `pnpm check`
  Typechecks every workspace package and example.
- `pnpm build`
  Builds the workspace packages and example apps.
- `pnpm test`
  Rebuilds the workspace and runs contract tests for spec validation, runtime behavior, SDK rendering, plugin artifact generation, CLI flows, and bootstrap-provider adapters.
- `pnpm test:goldens`
  Rebuilds the workspace and verifies checked-in golden artifact directories against the current generators.
- `pnpm test:update-goldens`
  Rebuilds the workspace and refreshes the checked-in golden artifact directories after intentional contract changes.

## Contract Review Workflow

1. Update source annotations, generators, or fixtures.
2. Run `pnpm test:update-goldens`.
3. Inspect the manifest file diffs under `tests/fixtures/**/expected`.
4. Run `pnpm test:goldens`.
5. Run `pnpm test`.

## Current Stability Boundaries

- The offline bootstrap path using `--captures-file` is the stable baseline for CI and documentation.
- Model-backed bootstrap retries only on timeouts, network failures, `429`, and `5xx` responses. Ordinary `4xx`, invalid JSON, invalid structured responses, and OpenAI refusals fail fast with normalized provider errors.
- Live Playwright capture is implemented, but still depends on the local browser/sandbox environment.
- Framework plugins and the CLI support deterministic extraction only:
  string literals, no-substitution template literals, same-file const alias chains, same-file const object-member reads, and same-file zero-arg helpers that reduce to static strings.
- Dynamic JSX expressions are skipped with diagnostics instead of being inferred.
- Extraction diagnostics are review signals, not CI blockers by default. The repo treats warning drift as important by asserting expected diagnostics in fixtures and goldens.
- Devtools remains read-only: live inspection, filtering, diffing, DOM discovery, and authoring patch-plan export are implemented in the extension, but repo mutation only happens through the CLI apply flow.
- The first write-back phase is intentionally narrow: `aic apply authoring-plan` only mutates proposals with one exact source match and only edits JSX opening-tag AIC props in place.
- Radix and shadcn coverage now handles common control-layer adoption paths, but it is still not a full design-system mirror or a guarantee for every custom component pattern.

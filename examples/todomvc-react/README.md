# TodoMVC React (AIC Instrumented)

This is a benchmark demonstration proving out [Agent Interaction Control (AIC)](https://github.com/aicorg/aic) within a canonical TodoMVC React application. It illustrates how to explicitly add context to standard React forms and interactive elements so that AI agents can holistically control the application without relying strictly on heuristics.

## ✨ Features
*   **Standard TodoMVC**: Uses canonical `@types/react` patterns alongside standard `todomvc-app-css` styling.
*   **Agent Controls**: Employs `@aicorg/sdk-react`'s `<AICInput>` and `<AICButton>` to annotate all core interactions.
*   **Automatic Manifest Generation**: Validates `agentId`, `agentDescription`, and `agentAction` via the `@aicorg/plugin-vite` dev middleware at runtime, allowing AI models to automatically discover available endpoints.
*   **MCP Playbook Validation**: Simulates how `@aicorg/mcp-server` dynamically queries the Vite middleware proxy during runtime to build semantic knowledge.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ensure dependencies are installed at the workspace level, then launch the React dev server from `examples/todomvc-react`:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The app will become available at `http://localhost:5173`. 
The AIC Vite plugin explicitly intercepts metadata requests on this server via the `.well-known` endpoints:
*   `http://localhost:5173/.well-known/agent.json`
*   `http://localhost:5173/.well-known/agent/ui`

## 🤖 Simulating MCP Tool Usage

To test how an autonomous agent fetches instructions and interactive boundaries via the AIC MCP tool layer, keep the dev server running and in another terminal run:

```bash
node simulate-mcp-client.mjs
```

This invokes the same MCP tool handlers shipped in `@aicorg/mcp-server` against the running app and writes the resulting discovery, UI, actions, and workflow payloads to `mcp-simulation-result.json`.

## 🎦 Demo Recording: Autonomous Browser Execution

AIC allows standard Vision+Action agents to semantically interface with applications reliably rather than struggling with inaccessible or opaque UI controls.

Below is an unedited recording of an AI agent automating the TodoMVC app visually—extracting its knowledge boundaries entirely from our newly attached `<AICProvider>` tree to successfully perform the following workflow:
1. Entering two distinct items
2. Confirming successful entry 
3. Toggling item status checkmarks precisely
4. Triggers the context-switching 'Clear completed' cleanup via precise layout bounds.
